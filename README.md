# Strips app

Part of Jeff Verkoeyen's digital archive.

- Year: 2009
- Platform: iPhone

## What was it?

A platform for distributing, reading, and monetizing web comics on mobile devices. Comics were
distributed with a mobile ads platform in order to create a revenue-sharing model with creators that
would be more lucrative than web ads served on mobile.

## What happened to it?

The platform was shut down after being poorly received by the community. Jeff had also just started
an internship at Facebook at the same time and didn't have time to commit to the project any
further.

This app is no longer available.
